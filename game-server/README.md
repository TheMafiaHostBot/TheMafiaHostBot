### TODO
* REST API server
* Game logic only
* In-memory game sessions (maybe some endpoints to get running game state from admin-app)
* Can be parallelized to several instances running in the same time
* Platform independent (no telegram specific logic except feedback)
* According to session platform type can send commands to specific platform server
